KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd

Background information:
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

Tasks:
Module Task 1:
Your task is to take a look at the following datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd and identify all data quality issues. Once you've had a look at these datasets, draft an email to the client identifying all data quality issues.

Module Task 2:
Create a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach we will be taking to identify which of the 1000 customers Sprocket Central Pty Ltd should target, based on this dataset. Explain the three phases:  Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Module Task 3:
Please develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance). Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd' should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list.
